This repository is intended to be used as a submodule
in a larger project using autotools, cwautomacros and
libcwd. It also depends on the submodule ai-utils.

To add it to a project, add the '.../xml/Makefile'
to AC_CONFIG_FILES of the configure.ac of that project.
For example,

AC_CONFIG_FILES([src/utils/Makefile]
                [src/xml/Makefile])

where src/xml is the path to this projects root.

Furthermore, configure.ac needs to contain something like:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
dnl Because we use cwautomacros.
CW_AUTOMACROS([20090610])

dnl Add --enable-debug (DEBUG, DOXYGEN_DEBUG), --enable-libcwd (CWDEBUG, DOXYGEN_CWDEBUG),
dnl --enable-optimise and --enable-profile options. Update USE_LIBCWD, CWD_LIBS and CXXFLAGS accordingly.
CW_OPG_FLAGS([-W -Wall -Woverloaded-virtual -Wundef -Wpointer-arith -Wwrite-strings -Winline])

dnl This source code is C++11.
CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS -std=c++11"

dnl Each Makefile.am should use DEFS = @DEFS@. Set DEFS here.
DEFS="-DHAVE_CONFIG_H"
AC_SUBST(DEFS)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is then all the requirements needed for the dependency
on cwautomacros (which has to be installed seperately) and libcwd,
except the latter also means you have to supply a 'debug.h'
and 'sys.h' (see the libcwd documentation).

Also add 'xml' to the SUBDIRS of Makefile.am of the
parent directory (ie src/Makefile.am). For example,

SUBDIRS = utils xml .

A directory with source files that include headers
from this submodule must include that 'src' path.
For example, the same src/Makefile.am could contain:

DEFAULT_INCLUDES=-iquote $(top_builddir) -iquote $(top_builddir)/src -iquote $(srcdir)

Note the last '-iquote $(srcdir)' which will allow
#include "xml/Reader.h"
in source files in src, while a src/foo/Makefile.am
that wanted to use src/utils would do:

DEFAULT_INCLUDES=-iquote $(top_builddir) -iquote $(top_builddir)/src -iquote $(srcdir)/..

Linking works as usual. For example a module that defines a

bin_PROGRAMS = foobar

would also define

foobar_LDADD = ../utils/.libs/libutils.a ../xml/.libs/libxml.a
foobar_DEPENDENCIES = ../utils/libutils.la ../xml/libxml.la

or whatever the path to xml (and utils) is.
